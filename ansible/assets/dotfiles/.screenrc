# HELP: Obviously can't scroll normally within a screen session,
# but here's how you do it:
# 1. Enter copy mode with Ctrl-J + [
# 2. Scroll up with Ctrl-u
# 3. Scroll down with Ctrl-d
# 4. Esc key to exit copy mode

# Set same PS1 as regular sessions
#PS1='[\[\e[1;31m\]\h\[\[\e[0m\]: \w]\[\e[0;32m\] \$\[\e[0m\] '
#term urxvt-unicode-256color

# Get .bash_profile settings
shell -$SHELL

# Default window title
shelltitle 'newwindow'

# No alert
vbell off

# Set a bigger scrollback than the default 100 lines
defscrollback 100000

# For PuTTY to recognize scrollback 
termcapinfo xterm ti@:te@

# No greeting
startup_message off

# Prefer ^J (usually unused) to ^A which breaks beginning of line command
escape ^Jj 

# Terminal supports UTF-8
defutf8 on

# Support alternate screens so that, for example, when you quit out of
# vi, the display is redrawn as it was before vi redrew the full screen.

# Show status bar on last line of screen, regardless of terminal hardstatus support
